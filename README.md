# How to Use Jest to Test Security Vulnerabilities in a User Login Scenario with JWT Authentication

In this guide, we’ll explore how to use Jest to test security vulnerabilities in a user login scenario that uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. Think of JWT as a special ticket that allows users to access certain areas of your application securely.

## What is JWT?

JWT is a way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It’s commonly used for authentication. When a user logs in, they receive a token that they must include in future requests to access protected resources.

### Why Test for Security Vulnerabilities?

Just like you wouldn’t want someone to sneak into a concert using a fake ticket, you need to ensure that your application properly verifies JWTs and protects sensitive information. Testing helps identify weaknesses that could allow unauthorized access.

## Setting Up Jest

### Step 1: Install Jest and Supertest

First, we need to install Jest and Supertest. Supertest helps us test our APIs by simulating requests.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm i --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest supertest
```

### Step 2: Configure Jest

Next, we need to configure Jest to work with TypeScript. Open your `package.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
"jest": {
  "preset": "ts-jest",
  "testEnvironment": "node"
}
```

### Step 3: Add a Test Script

In the same `package.json` file, add a script to run your tests:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Now, you can run your tests by typing `npm run test` in your terminal.

## User Login Scenario

Let’s create a simple user login scenario where users can log in and receive a JWT token. We’ll then test for common security vulnerabilities.

### 1. Successful Login

**What is it?**  
When a user provides valid credentials, they should receive a JWT token.

**How to Test It with Jest:**

```typescript
it('should return a JWT token on successful login', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/login')
    .send({
      username: 'validUser',
      password: 'validPassword'
    })
    .expect(HttpStatus.OK);
  
  expect(response.body.token).toBeDefined(); // Check if token is returned
});
```

### 2. Unauthorized Access

**What is it?**  
If a user tries to access a protected resource without a valid token, they should be denied access.

**How to Test It:**

```typescript
it('should return a 401 status code when accessing a protected endpoint without a token', async () => {
  await request(app)
    .get('/protected-endpoint')
    .expect(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED); // Expect unauthorized access
});
```

### 3. Invalid Token

**What is it?**  
If a user tries to access a protected resource with an invalid token, they should also be denied access.

**How to Test It:**

```typescript
it('should return a 401 status code when using an invalid token', async () => {
  await request(app)
    .get('/protected-endpoint')
    .set('Authorization', 'Bearer invalidToken')
    .expect(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED); // Expect unauthorized access
});
```

### 4. Token Expiration

**What is it?**  
Tokens should have an expiration time. If a user tries to use an expired token, they should be denied access.

**How to Test It:**

```typescript
it('should return a 401 status code when using an expired token', async () => {
  const expiredToken = generateExpiredToken(); // Function to create an expired token
  await request(app)
    .get('/protected-endpoint')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${expiredToken}`)
    .expect(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED); // Expect unauthorized access
});
```

### 5. Password Security

**What is it?**  
When a user tries to log in with a weak password, the system should reject the request.

**How to Test It:**

```typescript
it('should return a 422 status code for weak passwords', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/login')
    .send({
      username: 'newUser',
      password: '123' // Weak password
    })
    .expect(HttpStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY);
  
  expect(response.body.message).toBe('Password is not strong enough'); // Check error message
});
```

## Conclusion

Testing for security vulnerabilities in a user login scenario with JWT authentication is crucial to ensure that your application is secure. By using Jest, you can simulate various scenarios and check if your application behaves as expected.

Just like you wouldn’t want someone to sneak into a concert with a fake ticket, you need to ensure that your application properly verifies JWTs and protects sensitive information. By identifying and fixing these issues early, you can save time and money in the long run and keep your users safe!
